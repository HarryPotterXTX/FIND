I have a dataset dataset/solar.csv, help me find the variable with the highest contribution to Gravity.

I think the first six variables are suitable as inputs. Please set the input list to them and set the output to the prediction variable.

Use FIND to search formulas

The formula we discovered is y=x1^2/x3. Based on your background knowledge, derive and verify the rationality of this formula.

Now I am not considering the units of the inputs and outputs. Please use FIND to attempt to discover other formulas.
